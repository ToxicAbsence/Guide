**Version 0.2.0**

Block Pallet Conversion:
- Water, lava, fire, or snow could be replaced with certain blocks to create invalid states the blocks could not normally exist in. Due to the replacement of the block bypassing the initial update check, the blocks are able to be placed. So placing Cactus, Ladders, or Sugarcane on Water, Lava, Fire, or Snow can give you Cactus that is on the wrong block, invisible floating ladders, and SugarCane on wrong block or without water.

**Version 0.4.0**
- Gravity blocks like Sand and Gravel do not fall when placed in mid-air
- Placing a Door on Farmland will remove the bottom half of the Door leaving a Half Door
- Tilling a Farmland underwater will give you Underwater Farmland
- Smelting Red Mushrooms in a Furnace will give you Red Dye in the output slot of a Furance

**Version 0.6.0**
- Placing a Slab next to the World border and placing a block that requires wall support (e.g. torches, levers, ladders) will place them on the World Border which when updating to 0.12.0 infinite world will give you floating torches, levers, and ladders

**Version 0.8.0**
- Cactus can grow adjacent to blocks
- Torches can be placed inside paintings by placing torches and then placing a painting on the block that supports the Torches.

**Version 0.8.0 alpha build 4 - 0.8.0 test_1**
- Obtaining Carpets in 0.8.0 alpha build 4 and then downgrading to 0.8.0 test_1, you can place Carpets underwater.
